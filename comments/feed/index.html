		<description><![CDATA[Love this idea!  and have been chewing on it for awhile now.  My context is one of wanting to &quot;load&quot; one of two different video files.  The site is already mobile first, so my main case is simply loading the video file created for small screen viewing (e.g. lots of closeups and no camera movement).  My issue is how to write a media query in such a way as to detect the larger (&gt;1025 pixels) and then alternatively load the other video more suited for desktop screens.  Amongst other things, I keep stumbling over the fact that using &quot;display:none&quot; does not stop a mobile device from downloading that content.  

Using Modernizr&#039;s &quot;load&quot; feature and then a yepnope bit to load a javascript file that dynamically writes/insert the appropriate html code bit referencing the desired video file is where I am at at the moment.]]></description>
