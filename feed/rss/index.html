				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over ten years, OpenPlans has been an amazing incubator of people, ideas and projects. Maintaining our deeply-held belief in better cities thanks to technology and participation, we’ve built impactful, well-crafted software &#8211; with occasional organizational refreshes along the way. And now it&#8217;s time for another. Hold onto your hats!</p>
<p>Recently we’ve focused on the challenges of public involvement in urban planning. We made it easy to collect useful input via <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/README.md">Shareabouts maps</a>, and <a href="http://openplans.org/map-flavors/">simplified the process of setting up a map</a> alongside other information planners need to communicate. We&#8217;ve <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/category/planningtools/">learned and shared</a> a lot, via three <a href="http://planningcamp.org/">PlanningCamps</a>, many successful community engagements, and <a href="https://github.com/openplans/">a ton of open source code</a>. Just in the past few months, Shareabouts has supported engagement by tens of thousands of people in <a href="http://ideas.pbnyc.org/">New</a> <a href="http://nycbikeshare.herokuapp.com/">York</a> <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pages/maps-and-data/vz-input-map.shtml">City</a>, <a href="http://shareabouts-phila2035.herokuapp.com/">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="http://shareabouts-pbcambridge.herokuapp.com/">Cambridge</a>, <a href="http://shareabouts-pblongbeach.herokuapp.com/">Long Beach</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Despite these successes, not quite enough of the planning world is ready to use collaborative maps on their projects. So, at the end of January we cease our work as a team on these tools. The software group at OpenPlans will be on hiatus, and we&#8217;ll individually move onto new projects elsewhere. The other projects of our parent non-profit are continuing as strong as ever, with <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/">Streetsblog</a> and <a href="http://www.streetfilms.org/">Streetfilms</a> making a difference every day with must-read coverage of streets issues.</p>
<p>Shareabouts is <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts">open source</a>, and we’re hoping to see current users like <a href="http://placematters.org/">PlaceMatters</a> and <a href="http://www.altaplanning.com/">Alta Planning</a> continue working with and contributing to the software. Our own <a href="http://mjumbewu.flavors.me/">Mjumbe Poe</a> will be putting his deep Shareabouts knowledge to work, offering consulting and taking over some of OpenPlans’ existing projects.</p>
<p>Between now and the end of January, we have some nice improvements coming, making it even easier for anyone to set up and host their own map (<a href="http://community.openplans.org/t/new-self-contained-shareabouts-via-the-updated-heroku-button/49">like this one-click Heroku button</a> we&#8217;re testing, check it out). We hope these various efforts will see lots of meaningful community input happening via maps in the future. And before too long, tools like these will become part of the regular toolkit for outreach, engagement, and community data collection.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re really proud of the impact OpenPlans’ people and software have made so far, from bike share to bus tracking to participatory budgeting, and a whole lot more. Alums of OpenPlans are all over the place, working for some of the best cities and organizations out there. We&#8217;re excited about what comes next.</p>
<p>If you’ve crossed paths with OpenPlans, take a moment to <a href="https://github.com/openplans/history-of/tree/master/_posts">reminisce via pull request to this in-progress collaborative history</a>. We&#8217;ll be sharing that complete history soon, including highlights from our busy, high-impact 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During my fall fellowship at OpenPlans, I spent time exploring many different <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/12/21299/">tools for digital engagement</a>. Today&#8217;s my last day, so I want to share some thoughts about what the planner&#8217;s toolbox will look like in the future.</p>
<p>Choosing from a rich selection of great online tools, planners will be able to pick the right tool from their toolbox for the task at hand. Working this way requires a different <em>mindset</em>. It&#8217;s about approaching the problem in front of you with both traditional practices and digital tools in mind, and changing up the tools at different stages through the planning process.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>Public engagement using only traditional practices.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_21311" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trad-engagement.jpg"><img class="wp-image-21311" src="http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/trad-engagement.jpg" alt="the look on this guy's face says it all" width="500" height="332" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">this picture really is worth a thousand words</p></div>
<p><strong>Public engagement using only digital tools.</strong></p>
<p>For <a href="http://phila2035.org/">Phila2035</a>, there&#8217;s a broad engagement process going on, and digital tools are just a small part of the outreach process. That&#8217;s a good thing, because the digital tools may not reach everyone. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://shareabouts-phila2035.herokuapp.com/page/about">Phila2035&#8217;s Shareabouts map</a>, collecting information in South Philadelphia to guide the district plan. Look at the disparity in number of pins west of Broad Street (outlined in red),  compared to east of Broad Street. In the bottom right hand corner I outlined a section to show all that activity was from one user. Not necessarily a bad thing, but does suggest there is more than meets the eye when looking at just the pins on the map alone.</p>
<div id="attachment_21312" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sp-shareabouts.png"><img class="wp-image-21312" src="http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/sp-shareabouts.png" alt="powerful, but not always equitable" width="500" height="235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">powerful, but not always equitable</p></div>
<p>and finally &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Public engagement which balances traditional practices with digital tools. </strong></p>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2013-10/enhanced/webdr06/16/21/anigif_enhanced-buzz-5292-1381974742-6.gif" alt="" width="500" height="281" /><p class="wp-caption-text">the flow zone</p></div>
<p>Besides taking you to the planning flow zone, let&#8217;s take a moment to explore what else we know about the <em>potential</em> of balanced public engagement.</p>
<p>Incorporating digital tools enables you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategically deploy limited resources most effectively because digital tools show you you where people <strong>are not</strong> participating.</li>
<li>Add educational, hands on components to your current community meeting repertoire. For example, plug qualitative and quantitative data from the <strong>exploratory</strong> tools like a collaborative map into <strong>Budget Simulation</strong> and <strong>Scenario Modeling</strong> tools and create accurate, engaging activities for attendees.</li>
<li>Create plans based on data driven recommendations and a clear understanding of what the public wants. No more collecting dust on the shelf!</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">I&#8217;m starting to see anecdotal evidence of this potential. During the OpenPlans &amp; <a href="https://textizen.com/">Textizen</a> presentation recently at <a href="http://mapsphilagov.ticketleap.com/event-2/">Map, Measure, Manage</a>, Michelle and Mjumbe spoke about the Mayor&#8217;s Office of Transportation and Utilities ability to review the data halfway through the feedback collection process and then engage low response areas in-person.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the vision. And sure, its easy to proselytize when the blinding potential of civic tech traps your worldview within the metaphorical tunnel. Which is why it&#8217;s important to acknowledge today&#8217;s reality as well.  As a field, civic technology has some challenges to overcome before it has greater impact &#8211; problems like equitable access to technology, trust in government compared to trusting a company, widespread government willingness to provide open data publicly, procurement, and more. Digital engagement tools, within the civic tech umbrella, are subject to the same concerns.</p>
<p>But, that&#8217;s okay! Some of the smartest people I know are working on solving civic tech&#8217;s challenges (and not just OpenPlans and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/">CfA</a>, very interesting things happening <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">on the other side of the pond</a>). The other good news is, we planners can also help drive the field forward in a positive manner.</p>
<p>So instead of thinking about digital tools as a threat to replace existing practices, or as an either/or approach, instead conceptualize digital engagement instead as a <i>mindset</i>. This involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developing public engagement strategies which include a balance of in-person <i>and</i> digital from step one.</li>
<li>Relishing what is a steady influx of new resources for the first time in a long time.</li>
<li>And perhaps most importantly, taking an active role in building the tools you want to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the 3rd item above &#8212; this does not mean the same thing as building the tools yourself. Many opportunities exist for planners to contribute to development (lending subject matter expertise, writing documentation, usability testing, storytelling). Check to see if there is a local civic hacking group nearby, and there is a good chance you will find people willing to work with you on this project. Find one of the tools from the list of 50+ which is open source on Github and make a contribution, little changes add up over time and go a long way.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all from me (for now at least). I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing from you! What are some experiences you have had balancing traditional practices with digital tools? What is your favorite digital engagement tool to use as a planner? If it doesn&#8217;t exist yet, what would it be?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in September, Community Matters featured a blog post listing <a href="http://www.communitymatters.org/blog/let%E2%80%99s-get-digital-50-tools-online-public-engagement" target="_blank">50 tools for Online Public Engagement</a>. They gathered tools for digital outreach, ‘in no particular order (and with no implied endorsement)’.</p>
<p>I figured the list could be even more helpful if the tools were grouped by purpose and who uses them. Basically, what can the public do with the tool to engage in a project? And why might planners use it? Here are the groups:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Giving input about places via a map</li>
<li>Responding to surveys and giving input in other ways</li>
<li>Choosing priorities and setting budgets</li>
<li>Navigating the planning process together</li>
<li>Brainstorming ideas and reach decisions</li>
<li>Chatting on neighborhood social media</li>
<li>Sharing neighborhood knowledge</li>
<li>Reporting potholes and other municipal problems</li>
<li>Funding projects directly</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Digital engagement is more than just any one (or 50+) tools on the list, it&#8217;s a <em>mindset</em>. Approaching the planning problem in front of you with the intent to find a balance between in-person <em>and</em> digital engagement is more effective than using either approach alone. I&#8217;ll explore these ideas further in <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/12/exploring-digital-engagement-as-a-mindset/">a later blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Knowing the right tools to use is a good place to start, so without further ado here’s my remix of the list (plus a few more tools mentioned in the comments on the original blog post). These boundaries are not totally rigid, and there might be tools that belong in several categories.</p>
<h3>Giving input about places via a map</h3>
<p>These mapping tools enable participants to leave comments on maps, for example suggesting bike share locations or identifying community assets. Typically set up by planners for use by community members.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://crowdmap.com/welcome" target="_blank">Crowdmap</a> &#8211; if you want to make a web map to tell a story, this is a tool for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://openplans.org/shareabouts" target="_blank">Shareabouts</a> &#8211; choose a template (e.g. street safety, participatory budgeting) and have your map up and running, ready to collect public input, in minutes.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.tellus-toolkit.com/" target="_blank">TellUs Toolkit</a> &#8211; a cloud-based decision support system to help you engage stakeholders in a range of location based problems.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Sharing neighborhood knowledge</h3>
<p>Who knows a neighborhood better than the people living there? These engagement tools help people to share their what they know about the places they call home via idea generation, wikis, how-to guides, etc. Typically not set up by planners.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.communityalmanac.org/" target="_blank">Community Almanac</a> &#8211; a crowd-source wiki for people to share stories, local knowledge.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Report potholes and other municipal problems</h3>
<p>Not a tool for direct input into a planning process, these tools help residents notify government about problems, or see the status of previously-reported issues. Easier than calling 311 or visiting City Hall. Typically, these tools are set up by a city government for use by residents. Planners can use the data from these tools to understand longstanding neighborhood issues, but the primary purpose of the tool is identifying issues for the city to fix.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/apps/adopt-a-hydrant/" target="_blank">Adopt a Hydrant</a> &#8211; an app for citizens to claim responsibility for shoveling out nearby hydrants after a snowstorm.</li>

</ul>
<h3>… and finally</h3>
<p>These tools were in the list of 50, but I don’t see them as directly contributing to citizen engagement. These aren’t tools that planners can use to increase participation in a project tomorrow. They may be important in the civic tech world, but don’t actively contribute to citizen engagement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/geoweek">#GeoWeek</a> is a celebration of all things geographic, promoted by the National Geographic Society. <br/><br/></p>
<p>If your celebrations this week tend towards working on an open source geo application, <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts">check out Shareabouts</a>. We’re always happy to help new contributors get started over at <a href="http://community.openplans.org">community.openplans.org</a>, and we have <a href="https://trello.com/b/94MT3WRQ/openplans-roadmap">a long list of potential new features</a>. GeoWeek or not, we always welcome participation in building our open tools.<br/><br/></p>
<p>An especially interesting component for GeoWeek 2014 is a <a href="http://osmgeoweek.org/">partnership with OpenStreetMap to host a number of mapping events around the country</a>. OpenStreetMap, like open source projects, thrives and succeeds when people actively contribute toward development, whether through providing data, ideas, or advocacy. <br/><br/></p>
<p>Host an OSM mapping party or <a href="http://osmgeoweek.org/events/">find one happening near you</a>. Whether you&#8217;re just getting started or an expert, you have plenty of options. So stop reading, and start participating! </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New in OpenPlans today: explore your collaborative map with our fresh map + table combination. Knowing what people say is important, knowing where they are saying it is even better.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21285" src="http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/map-table-wow1.gif" alt="map-table-wow" width="600" height="386" /></p>
<p>Previously, you had to export data from your map to desktop GIS to map it. Now, just open your plan&#8217;s dashboard and dive in. The map and table are linked, so you can search and see the search results on the map. You can still download your data for offline investigation and reporting when needed.</p>
<p>Take the table view for a test ride today &#8211; log in with user <em>testride</em> and password <em>testride</em> at <a href="https://openplans.org/test-ride/nyc-street-safety-map/dashboard/">openplans.org/test-ride/nyc-street-safety-map/dashboard/</a>. Or click the dashboard icon in your plan list to see what your map is collecting.</p>
<p>We have more map and analytical tools coming. Help us prioritize them with your <a href="mailto:hello@openplans.org">feedback</a>!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With a new template, we're helping collect feedback about favorable and unfavorable biking conditions.

Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning is doing <a href="http://foxrivertrailconnections.org/">a feasibility study for a new bike trail</a> in northeastern Illinois. The study will identify potential routes, and after analysis recommend the appropriate type of bicycle facility. Check out the project at <a href="http://foxrivertrailconnections.org/">foxrivertrailconnections.org</a>.

To inform the study, cyclists can use an OpenPlans map to provide four types of input - favorite destinations, desirable and undesirable bike routes, and difficult crossings. Our new bike trail plan template also includes questions about home municipality and other demographic info, to help the planners know who is engaging. As input comes in, the project team can explore all shared locations and comments <a title="Table view is here!" href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/11/table-view-is-here/">via their dashboard</a>. And like all OpenPlans maps, the site works great on desktop or mobile.]]></description>
